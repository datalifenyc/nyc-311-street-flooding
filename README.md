# Analyzing NYC's 311 Street Flooding Complaints from 2010 to Present

By Mark Bauer  

I conducted an analysis of Street Flooding Complaints with NYC Open Data's 311 dataset. 

Notebooks:  
- My findings and analysis are available in the [311-street-flooding-complaints.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-311-street-flooding/blob/main/311-street-flooding-complaints.ipynb) in this repository.  
- Data wrangling for exporting the 311 data using Socrata's API is available in the [data-wrangling-311-data.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-311-street-flooding/blob/main/data-wrangling-311-data.ipynb) in this repository.
- Data wrangling for assigning complaints to streets is available in the [assign-complaints-to-streets.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-311-street-flooding/blob/main/assign-complaints-to-streets.ipynb) in this repository.  
- Data wrangling for clipping and extracting only NYC streets is available in the [data-wrangling-streets-data.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-311-street-flooding/blob/main/data-wrangling-streets-data.ipynb) in this repository.  

Data:  
Data used in the analysis can be found in the [data](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-311-street-flooding/tree/main/data) folder. This includes:
