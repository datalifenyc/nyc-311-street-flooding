- Data wrangling for exporting the 311 data using Socrata's API is available in the [data-wrangling-311-data.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-311-street-flooding/blob/main/data-wrangling-311-data.ipynb) in this repository.
- Data wrangling for assigning complaints to streets is available in the [assign-complaints-to-streets.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-311-street-flooding/blob/main/assign-complaints-to-streets.ipynb) in this repository.
